# Integration tests for afpfs-ng

## Test suite overview

| File | Tests |
| ---- | ----- |
| `test_afpcmd_batch.t` | Uploads a file to an AFP share via `afpcmd` batch mode, downloads it back, and verifies the checksum matches. |
| `test_afpcmd_interactive.t` | Exercises `afpcmd` interactive mode by piping command sequences through stdin and asserting expected output patterns. |
| `test_afpgetstatus.t` | Verifies `afpgetstatus` can retrieve and parse AFP server status information. |
| `test_fuse.t` | Mounts an AFP share via `mount_afpfs` (FUSE), writes and reads a file with an authenticated mount, verifies the file is visible on a guest mount, then cleans up with a second authenticated mount. |

`test_fuse.t` must be run stand-alone on a real host — FUSE kernel support is not reliable inside containers. See below.

All tests use `Test::More` (Perl core) and are run with `prove`.

The tests assume a netatalk AFP server is running locally with a share at `afp://localhost/afpfs_test`
that allows both guest and authenticated access.
The authenticated user is `test_usr` with password `test_pwd`.
See Manual environment prep below for setup instructions.

## Container tests (batch + interactive only)

Build and run the container friendly tests inside a self-contained container image.
The image compiles afpfs-ng from source and includes a netatalk AFP server.

### Build

```sh
podman build -f test/Dockerfile -t afpfs-ng-test .
```

### Run

```sh
podman run --rm afpfs-ng-test
```

`prove` exits non-zero on any test failure, which causes the container to exit with a non-zero status.

## Stand-alone tests

### Prerequisites

- afpfs-ng built and installed (`afpcmd`, `afpfsd`, `mount_afpfs`, `afp_client` on `PATH`)
- netatalk installed and configured (see Manual environment prep below)
- Perl (any recent version; all modules used are in core)

Follow the steps in entrypoint.sh script to configure users and a shared volume for a netatalk AFP server used by the tests.

### Running batch and interactive tests

```sh
cd test
prove test_afpcmd_batch.t
pkill -x afpsld || true
while pgrep -x afpsld > /dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 0.1; done
prove test_afpcmd_interactive.t
```

The `afpsld` session daemon is killed between the two test runs to ensure a clean slate for the interactive suite.

### Running the FUSE test

`test_fuse.t` requires a real kernel FUSE mount and must be run on the host (not inside a container):

```sh
cd test
prove test_fuse.t
```

The test creates an `afpfs_mnt/` directory in the current working directory and removes it implicitly when unmounted.
If a run is interrupted mid-test, unmount manually before re-running:

```sh
afp_client unmount ./afpfs_mnt
```
