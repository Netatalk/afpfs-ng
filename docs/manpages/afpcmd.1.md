# NAME

afpcmd - Transfer files over the network using the Apple Filing
Protocol (AFP)

# SYNOPSIS

**afpcmd** \[-r\] \[*afp url*\]

# DESCRIPTION

**afpcmd** is a command-line tool to help transfer files to and from a
server using AFP. This is typically either Netatalk or Mac OS or Mac OS
X.

This can be done as a non-root user. It offers either an interactive
command-line (like a traditional FTP client) or for batch retrievals.

Do not confuse this with the FUSE mounting tools (mount_afpfs, afpfsd,
afp_client), which offer the ability to mount an entire filesystem.

# OPTIONS

**-r** sets the recursive flag.

**afp url** uses the standard AFP URL format.

# AFP version support

Look at the afpfs-ng documentation for more information on specific AFP
version compatibility information.

# Batch mode

Batch file transfers can be done in one of two ways:

*afpcmd -r \[***afp url to directory**\]

This does a recursive transfer of all subdirectories and files locally.

*afpcmd \[***afp url to file**\]

This transfers just the file locally.

After either of these is finished, the command exits.

# Interactive mode

If a URL is provided on the command line, afpcmd connects and enters the
volume and directory specified.

Standard readline keystrokes are enabled. Command line competion (using
tab) and history (using up and down arrows) is provided. Local filename
completion is enabled.

# AFP URLs

A typical usage of afpcmd is:

If a password of "-" is provided, the user is prompted for a password.
