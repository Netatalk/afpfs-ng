# Getting Started with afpfs-ng

This is a quick guide on how to use the two different AFP clients
in afpfs-ng.

## The FUSE client

This will let you mount remote filesystems.

As the user who will be needing to access the files, start the management daemon
by running:

    afpfsd --manager

This should fork off.  You should see messages in /var/log/messages.  For more
details, run it with the '--debug' option to see detailed debug info.

Note that if afpfsd is not running, afp_client or mount_afpfs will start it
automatically, so in most cases you don't need to start it manually.

Mount the _File Sharing_ volume from afpserver.local on /home/myuser/fusemount
authenticated as user _myuser_ (you will be prompted for the password):

    % mount_afpfs "afp://myuser@afpserver.local/File Sharing" /home/myuser/fusemount

After inputting the password when prompted, you should be able to access files on _fusemount_.

Mount the _Dropbox_ volume as guest without authentication (the server must allow guest access):

    % mount_afpfs "afp://afpserver.local/Dropbox" /home/myuser/fusemount

The same, but forcing the UAM of your choice with the _AUTH_ parameter (usually not needed):

    % mount_afpfs "afp://myuser;AUTH=dhx:-@afpserver.local/File Sharing" /home/myuser/fusemount

You can see status by running 'afp_client status'.  See afpfsd(1),
mount_afpfs(1) and afp_client(1) for more info.

To add an AFP mount to fstab so it mounts automatically on boot:

1. create a file called '/etc/fuse.conf' with one line:
`user_allow_other`
2. make sure that any user doing a mount is a member of the group 'fuse' so it can read and write to /dev/fuse
3. create an entry in /etc/fstab entry in the following format:

    afpfs#afp://username:mypass10.211.55.2/alexdevries /tmp/xa20 fuse user=adevries,group=fuse 0 0

Here, username and mypass are the login information on the server 10.211.55.2.
The volume name is alexdevries.  /tmp/xa20 is the name of the mountpoint.  
The user= field is the local user, group needs to be the same the group owner of /dev/fuse (which is typically fuse).

Yes, you will need to put your password in clear text.  There is currently no facility to handle open directory.
Patches welcome.

## Running the command line client

There are two modes:

### interactive mode

afpcmd is a command line tool like an FTP client.

Just run:

    afpcmd "afp://username@servername/volumename"

If you enter no volumename, it shows which ones are available.
You can put a password after the username - "username:password" - but it's usually better
to let it prompt you for the password so it doesn't end up in your shell history.

Examples of available commands:

- get _filename_: retrieves the filename
- put _filename_: send the file
- ls: show directory listings

Others are available too; touch, chmod, chown, rm, mv, etc.  See
afpcmd(1) for more.

### batch transfer

This will let you quickly transfer one file or recursively a directory,
and then return you to the command prompt.

E.g.

    > afpcmd afp://user:pass@server/alexdevries/linux-2.6.14.tar.bz2 .
    Connected to server Cubalibre using UAM "DHX2"
    Connected to volume alexdevries
        Getting file /linux-2.6.14.tar.bz2
    Transferred 39172170 bytes in 2.862 seconds. (13687 kB/s)

See afpcmd(1) for more information.

## getting status

You can get status information on servers with 'afpgetstatus _servername_'.  
This provides some information without having to log in.

See afpgetstatus(1) for more information.
