afpfs-ng Improvements
=====================

General client shortcomings
---------------------------

* integration with avahi/bonjour
* shutting down notices aren't honoured

Command line client
-------------------

* read and write extended attributes
* paginate directory listings with >256 files

FUSE client
-----------

* do correct address/signature matching; right now we don't actually use
  the signature.
* retain resource fork data stored in extended attributes when copying
* parse Classic Mac OS icons from resource forks

AFP 3.x
-------

* filenames have a maximum length of 255, but AFP 3.x allows for much more
* ACL support

AFP 2.x
-------

* use getsrvrinfo to get connection IP address to make room for AT
* connection recovery
  * open files
  * locked files
* desktop database support
* UTF8 flag is now server-specific, but it should be volume-specific

Authentitcation
---------------

* ClientKRB
* reconnection
* Open directory integration

Performance
-----------

* in mknod(), you only need to do the setfiledirparms if the mode or perms
are different
* asynchronous unlocking
* use rx and tx quantums properly
* queue writes to be one tx quantum
* optimize locking
* don't go back through the select loop to read what comes after the DSI
packet
* make a preallocated pool of dsi requests
* make a preallocated pool for dsi messages
* is_dir function should look in did cache
* check to see how Mac OS does locking on writes
* large block writes for FUSE 3.x

Protocol bugs
-------------

* afpfs-ng doesn't handle the situation where the server is shutdown
* reconnect isn't reliable
* If a DSI stream gets broken or there's a protocol error, the connection
  should be reset
* for logins, fpLoginExt should be used instead of fpLogin
* for fpCreateFile, use soft creates
* honour volume's HasConfigInfo flag
